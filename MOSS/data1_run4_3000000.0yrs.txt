# Initial conditions:
#   Using the single star models from /home/adesai/snap/firefox/common/Downloads/evolutionary_tracks/grid_006_single_star/ to determine the radii of donors at different evolutionary stages
#   This means that we assume metallicity, Z=0.006
#   Using the lifetimes of stars from single star models in/home/adesai/snap/firefox/common/Downloads/evolutionary_tracks/grid_006_single_star/
#   IMF: Kroupa, M_min = 0.1 Msun, M_max = 100.0 Msun 
# We assume the star-formation type: starburst, with a total mass of stars of 1000000.0 Msun
# This file contains the information about the stars that are present in the population after 3000000.0 years
#   fbin:moe
#   q distribution: flat, 0.1 < q < 1.0
#   P distribution: Sana+12 for M1>15 Msun and Opik24 for M1<15 Msun
#
# Physical assumptions:
#   Critical mass ratio for the donor main sequence, q_crit_MS=0.65
#   Critical mass ratio for the donor Hertzsprung gap, q_crit_HG=0.4
#   Using the alpha-prescription for common envelope evolution
#   alpha_CE = 1.0, lambda_CE = 0.5
#   Using the binary star models from /home/adesai/snap/firefox/common/Downloads/evolutionary_tracks/grid_006/ to determine the masses and radii of stripped stars
#   Stripped stars can only be formed from donor stars with 2.0 < M1init/Msun < 100.0
#   Actually, we assume that binary interaction only can occur in the above mass range.
#   For stripped stars we set the total lifetime to tau_MS+tau_strip, where the duration of the stripped phases (tau_strip) come from the binary models in/home/adesai/snap/firefox/common/Downloads/evolutionary_tracks/grid_006/
#   Mass transfer efficiency is set to beta_MS = 1.0, beta_HG = 0.0, beta_HG_CEE = 0.0
#   For mergers, we assume that their final mass is M1init+M2init
#   The final period is set by the treatment of angular momentum during interaction, we ignore the effect of wind mass loss on the period.
#   We use the isotropic_reemission setting for the treatment of angular momentum.
#   For common envelope, the period is set in the alpha prescription
#   Rejuvenation of mass gainers and MSMS mergers is set by Tout97
#   HGMS mergers are not rejuvenated, but their lifetimes are adapted to the new mass
#
# Even though the full population synthesis accounts for the full mass range from 0.1 to 100.0 Msun, 
# I will only keep the stars with initial masses (Minit or M1init) between 2.0 and 100.0 Msun.
# I am ignoring single stars that died and binaries in which at least the primary died.
# I show dead secondaries as long as the primary is still alive
# For the star state: 1 - main-sequence star, 2 - stripped star, 3 - post main-sequence star, 4 - compact object, 51 - merger product in MS stage.
# In this output, we only output the stripped star systems.
