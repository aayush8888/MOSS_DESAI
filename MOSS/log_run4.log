 ----- SUMMARY OF INPUT ----- 

Only single stars are computed - no binaries!!!
The location of the single star evolutionary model grid is /home/adesai/snap/firefox/common/Downloads/evolutionary_tracks/grid_006_single_star/
The location of the binary star evolutionary model grid is /home/adesai/snap/firefox/common/Downloads/evolutionary_tracks/grid_006/

Excluding post-MS evolution, the star dies at TAMS...

The metallicity is Z = 0.006

This is using constant starformation type
The star-formation rate is 0.2 Msun/yr 

Using an IMF from Kroupa
Setting the mass limits to 0.1-100.0MSun

Using the binary fraction setting: constant
The fraction of stars born in binaries is set to: 0.0

 ----- SUMMARY OF INPUT ----- 

Only single stars are computed - no binaries!!!
The location of the single star evolutionary model grid is /home/adesai/snap/firefox/common/Downloads/evolutionary_tracks/grid_006_single_star/
The location of the binary star evolutionary model grid is /home/adesai/snap/firefox/common/Downloads/evolutionary_tracks/grid_006/

Excluding post-MS evolution, the star dies at TAMS...

The metallicity is Z = 0.006

This is using constant starformation type
The star-formation rate is 0.2 Msun/yr 

Using an IMF from Kroupa
Setting the mass limits to 0.1-100.0MSun

Using the binary fraction setting: constant
The fraction of stars born in binaries is set to: 0.0

IMF: picking masses of stars
Going to run 400 loops
Starting turn 1..........
IMF gives a total stellar mass of 49999.79947091346 MSun and 78413 number of stars 
Assigned birthdays to the stars 

BINARY FRACTION: Going to pick which stars are in binaries 
Assuming a mass-independent binary fraction of fbin = 0.5
Number of binaries: 38974 (not corrected for total mass yet) 

MASS RATIO: Choosing masses of companions by randomly drawing from a mass ratio distribution 
Assigned masses to the secondaries following a flat distribution in mass ratio. 
Removed some random stars so that the total mass is what we want. 
Total mass: 49978.65383393157 MSun, 30695 binaries 
Set the birthday of the secondaries to the same as the primaries 

PERIOD: Going to assign orbital periods to the systems... 
Used the combination of Opik and Sana+12 for the period distribution
The minimum period for the Sana+12 distribution is 1.4125375446227544days, while the Opik distribution goes to minimum possible period.
Ignoring widening via wind mass loss.
Interpolation: Assigned masses to the stripped stars using interpolation in log10 for both mstrip and minit.
Instead of extrapolating, we use the He-core masses at TAMS for massive stripped stars
The code cannot handle Case A stripped star masses yet - simply assumes it is as stable Case B for all...

Interpolation: The radius limits from the single star grid linearly with the initial masses
Translated the radius limits to period limits using the Roche potential
Systems that go through stable Case A and stable Case B assigned... 
Systems that merge during main sequence and after helium burnign assigned... 
Entering the alpha-prescription 
Assuming that common envelope is initiated either because q < q_crit_HG or the donor has a convective envelope 
Interpolation: The radii of the stripped stars were interpolated and extrapolated using log10 of mstrip and log10 of rstrip 
Assuming that a binary survives common envelope if the two (assuming circular) stars both fit in the orbit.

 ----- SUMMARY OF INPUT ----- 

Binary stars are included
The location of the single star evolutionary model grid is /home/adesai/snap/firefox/common/Downloads/evolutionary_tracks/grid_006_single_star/
The location of the binary star evolutionary model grid is /home/adesai/snap/firefox/common/Downloads/evolutionary_tracks/grid_006/

Excluding post-MS evolution, the star dies at TAMS...

The metallicity is Z = 0.006

This is using constant starformation type
The star-formation rate is 0.2 Msun/yr 

Using an IMF from Kroupa
Setting the mass limits to 0.1-100.0MSun

Using the binary fraction setting: constant
The fraction of stars born in binaries is set to: 0.5

The mass ratio distribution is: flat
We allow for mass ratios between 0.1 < M2/M1 < 1.0

The period distribution is: Opik_Sana
The switch from Opik to Sana occurs at 15.0 MSun
The minimum period for the Sana+12 part is 1.4125375446227544days, while the Opik part goes to ZAMS radius.
The maximum period is set to 3162.2776601683795days

Common envelope on main sequence develops if the mass ratio is <0.65
Common envelope on Hertzsprung gap develops if the mass ratio is <0.4

The alpha-prescription is used for modeling common envelopes (initiated on HG, otherwise assumed merge)
The efficiency factor, alpha, for common envelope is set to: 1.0
The structure parameter, lambda, for common envelope is set to: 0.5

We assume that stripped stars can be formed from stars with Minit =2.0-100.0MSun
This mass range is actually the only mass range we consider binary interaction active

The mass accretion efficiency on the MS (Case A) is set to: 1.0
The mass accretion efficiency on the HG (Case B) is set to: 0.0
The mass accretion during common envelope initiated on the HG (Case B_CEE) is set to: 0.0

Angular momentum during mass transfer is treated as: isotropic_reemission

Rejuvenation is set as: Tout97

Assuming that a binary survives common envelope if the two (assuming circular) stars both fit in the orbit.
It has then created a stripped star

Updated which stars that interact in which way... 
Interpolation: Assigned lifetimes of the stars (single stellar grid) 
Interpolation: Assigned main sequence durations of the stars (single stellar grid)

 ----- SUMMARY OF INPUT ----- 

Binary stars are included
The location of the single star evolutionary model grid is /home/adesai/snap/firefox/common/Downloads/evolutionary_tracks/grid_006_single_star/
The location of the binary star evolutionary model grid is /home/adesai/snap/firefox/common/Downloads/evolutionary_tracks/grid_006/

Excluding post-MS evolution, the star dies at TAMS...

The metallicity is Z = 0.006

This is using constant starformation type
The star-formation rate is 0.2 Msun/yr 

Using an IMF from Kroupa
Setting the mass limits to 0.1-100.0MSun

Using the binary fraction setting: constant
The fraction of stars born in binaries is set to: 0.5

The mass ratio distribution is: flat
We allow for mass ratios between 0.1 < M2/M1 < 1.0

The period distribution is: Opik_Sana
The switch from Opik to Sana occurs at 15.0 MSun
The minimum period for the Sana+12 part is 1.4125375446227544days, while the Opik part goes to ZAMS radius.
The maximum period is set to 3162.2776601683795days

Common envelope on main sequence develops if the mass ratio is <0.65
Common envelope on Hertzsprung gap develops if the mass ratio is <0.4

The alpha-prescription is used for modeling common envelopes (initiated on HG, otherwise assumed merge)
The efficiency factor, alpha, for common envelope is set to: 1.0
The structure parameter, lambda, for common envelope is set to: 0.5

We assume that stripped stars can be formed from stars with Minit =2.0-100.0MSun
This mass range is actually the only mass range we consider binary interaction active

The mass accretion efficiency on the MS (Case A) is set to: 1.0
The mass accretion efficiency on the HG (Case B) is set to: 0.0
The mass accretion during common envelope initiated on the HG (Case B_CEE) is set to: 0.0

Angular momentum during mass transfer is treated as: isotropic_reemission

Rejuvenation is set as: Tout97

 ----- SUMMARY OF INPUT ----- 

Binary stars are included
The location of the single star evolutionary model grid is /home/adesai/snap/firefox/common/Downloads/evolutionary_tracks/grid_006_single_star/
The location of the binary star evolutionary model grid is /home/adesai/snap/firefox/common/Downloads/evolutionary_tracks/grid_006/

Excluding post-MS evolution, the star dies at TAMS...

The metallicity is Z = 0.006

This is using constant starformation type
The star-formation rate is 0.2 Msun/yr 

Using an IMF from Kroupa
Setting the mass limits to 0.1-100.0MSun

Using the binary fraction setting: constant
The fraction of stars born in binaries is set to: 0.5

The mass ratio distribution is: flat
We allow for mass ratios between 0.1 < M2/M1 < 1.0

The period distribution is: Opik_Sana
The switch from Opik to Sana occurs at 15.0 MSun
The minimum period for the Sana+12 part is 1.4125375446227544days, while the Opik part goes to ZAMS radius.
The maximum period is set to 3162.2776601683795days

Common envelope on main sequence develops if the mass ratio is <0.65
Common envelope on Hertzsprung gap develops if the mass ratio is <0.4

The alpha-prescription is used for modeling common envelopes (initiated on HG, otherwise assumed merge)
The efficiency factor, alpha, for common envelope is set to: 1.0
The structure parameter, lambda, for common envelope is set to: 0.5

We assume that stripped stars can be formed from stars with Minit =2.0-100.0MSun
This mass range is actually the only mass range we consider binary interaction active

The mass accretion efficiency on the MS (Case A) is set to: 1.0
The mass accretion efficiency on the HG (Case B) is set to: 0.0
The mass accretion during common envelope initiated on the HG (Case B_CEE) is set to: 0.0

Angular momentum during mass transfer is treated as: isotropic_reemission

Rejuvenation is set as: Tout97

 ----- SUMMARY OF INPUT ----- 

Binary stars are included
The location of the single star evolutionary model grid is /home/adesai/snap/firefox/common/Downloads/evolutionary_tracks/grid_006_single_star/
The location of the binary star evolutionary model grid is /home/adesai/snap/firefox/common/Downloads/evolutionary_tracks/grid_006/

Excluding post-MS evolution, the star dies at TAMS...

The metallicity is Z = 0.006

This is using constant starformation type
The star-formation rate is 0.2 Msun/yr 

Using an IMF from Kroupa
Setting the mass limits to 0.1-100.0MSun

Using the binary fraction setting: constant
The fraction of stars born in binaries is set to: 0.5

The mass ratio distribution is: flat
We allow for mass ratios between 0.1 < M2/M1 < 1.0

The period distribution is: Opik_Sana
The switch from Opik to Sana occurs at 15.0 MSun
The minimum period for the Sana+12 part is 1.4125375446227544days, while the Opik part goes to ZAMS radius.
The maximum period is set to 3162.2776601683795days

Common envelope on main sequence develops if the mass ratio is <0.65
Common envelope on Hertzsprung gap develops if the mass ratio is <0.4

The alpha-prescription is used for modeling common envelopes (initiated on HG, otherwise assumed merge)
The efficiency factor, alpha, for common envelope is set to: 1.0
The structure parameter, lambda, for common envelope is set to: 0.5

We assume that stripped stars can be formed from stars with Minit =2.0-100.0MSun
This mass range is actually the only mass range we consider binary interaction active

The mass accretion efficiency on the MS (Case A) is set to: 1.0
The mass accretion efficiency on the HG (Case B) is set to: 0.0
The mass accretion during common envelope initiated on the HG (Case B_CEE) is set to: 0.0

Angular momentum during mass transfer is treated as: isotropic_reemission

Rejuvenation is set as: Tout97

 ----- SUMMARY OF INPUT ----- 

Binary stars are included
The location of the single star evolutionary model grid is /home/adesai/snap/firefox/common/Downloads/evolutionary_tracks/grid_006_single_star/
The location of the binary star evolutionary model grid is /home/adesai/snap/firefox/common/Downloads/evolutionary_tracks/grid_006/

Excluding post-MS evolution, the star dies at TAMS...

The metallicity is Z = 0.006

This is using constant starformation type
The star-formation rate is 0.2 Msun/yr 

Using an IMF from Kroupa
Setting the mass limits to 0.1-100.0MSun

Using the binary fraction setting: constant
The fraction of stars born in binaries is set to: 0.5

The mass ratio distribution is: flat
We allow for mass ratios between 0.1 < M2/M1 < 1.0

The period distribution is: Opik_Sana
The switch from Opik to Sana occurs at 15.0 MSun
The minimum period for the Sana+12 part is 1.4125375446227544days, while the Opik part goes to ZAMS radius.
The maximum period is set to 3162.2776601683795days

Common envelope on main sequence develops if the mass ratio is <0.65
Common envelope on Hertzsprung gap develops if the mass ratio is <0.4

The alpha-prescription is used for modeling common envelopes (initiated on HG, otherwise assumed merge)
The efficiency factor, alpha, for common envelope is set to: 1.0
The structure parameter, lambda, for common envelope is set to: 0.5

We assume that stripped stars can be formed from stars with Minit =2.0-100.0MSun
This mass range is actually the only mass range we consider binary interaction active

The mass accretion efficiency on the MS (Case A) is set to: 1.0
The mass accretion efficiency on the HG (Case B) is set to: 0.0
The mass accretion during common envelope initiated on the HG (Case B_CEE) is set to: 0.0

Interpolation prepared for main sequence, post-main sequence, and stripped stars (if included) 
Allowing for extrapolation at the edges if the model did not reach central helium depletion.
(Just assuming the star has the same properties until when central helium depletion is expected.)

Post main sequence star properties done for single stars and binaries. Evaluated at 50.0Myr
Stripped star properties done!. Evaluated at 50.0Myr
Saved an HRD for the population

Updated the star-states of stars in systems that fill their Roche lobe (adding a minus).

There are 9 cases of M2 overfilling...
Wrote to data file #1 (data1_run4_50000000.0yrs.txt)... 
This file contains properties predicted by MESA.

Starting to evaluate population after 70000000.0 years.
Assigned apparent ages of the stars that are present in the population. 

Checked the evolutionary states of the stars at the evaluation time. 
I have neglected late interaction objects. 

Interpolation prepared for main sequence, post-main sequence, and stripped stars (if included) 
Allowing for extrapolation at the edges if the model did not reach central helium depletion.
(Just assuming the star has the same properties until when central helium depletion is expected.) 
Used the interpolation scheme to find properties of the stars 
I extrapolated the properties for the secondaries with M < 2 Msun
