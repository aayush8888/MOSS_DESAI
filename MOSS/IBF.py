""" This script allows for testing various initial B-field functions (IBFs), 
as well as defining the ratio of magnetic to non-magnetic stars in the population. 
While the concept of the IBF is analogous to the IMF, there is an additional variable, 
the above mentioned ratio or incidence rate. 
The *currently observed* incidence rate is established to be roughly 10%
in the Galaxy, based on observations of ~1,000 stars. It is unknown in other metallicities.
The *currently observed* distribution of magnetic field strengths is roughly lognormal (Shultz+2019).
Thus the main questions are: 
What is the IBF that allows for reproducing the currently observed range of field strength, and
what is the initial B_frac that allows for the currently determined incidence rate.
